## Why
The project requires a formal initialization referencing the planning document (@plan.md) and a setup of AGENTS.md with conventions and instructions referencing @CLAUDE.md. This ensures clear guidance for future development and agent behavior.

## What Changes
- Initialize the project with reference to @plan.md.
- Setup AGENTS.md with reference to @CLAUDE.md.

## Impact
- Affected specs: project-init, agents-setup
- Affected code: openspec/project.md, openspec/AGENTS.md
