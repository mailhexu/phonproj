## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Implement calculation of eigenvectors and eigendisplacements for a list of q-points using the phonopy API
- [x] 1.2 Implement function to plot the band structure, referencing band_structure.py
- [x] 1.3 Add tests to plot the band structure for BaTiO3 and PbTiO3
- [x] 1.4 Validate with openspec validate add-band-structure-calc --strict and resolve any issues
