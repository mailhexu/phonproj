# Tasks: Add Eigenvector Projection Capability

1. Implement `project_eigenvectors(q_index, unit_vector)` method in PhononModes class
2. Implement `verify_completeness(q_index, unit_vector, tolerance)` method in PhononModes class
3. Add tests in `tests/test_eigenvectors/` for projection and completeness
4. Add minimal working example in `examples/` demonstrating projection and completeness check
5. Update documentation to reference new methods and their usage
6. Validate implementation against BaTiO3 and PbTiO3 test cases
7. Run openspec validation and resolve any issues
